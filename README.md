Get both of these extensions:
- Live Sass Compiler by Glenn Marks
- Live Server by Ritwick Dey

Live Sass Compiler (specifically by Glenn Marks) will convert the .scss files to .css for the site to use.

![watch-sass](https://i.imgur.com/lFFd1pE.png)<br>
When using the Compiler, you have to click this 'Watch Sass' button at the bottom. This will compile on save.<br>
You can view changes in real time, using the Live Server:<br>
 In the HTML file, right click and select 'Open with Live Server'.<br>
 This will open the site in your browser.

 I've done my best to comment everything that I've done, so read through and make sure it makes sense.<br>
 In terms of the colours, I pulled them from the Sheffield website. I'm not 100% sure about them, but they can be easily changed in _variables.scss
